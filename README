This is a proof of concept for a Camping-like Orbit. Current
functionality is very minimal (routes and dispatching, basic
views with layout support, no processing of query strings or
post data).

Installation:

Make sure your Lua interpreter is called lua51 and it is in
your path, then do:

configure
make all
make install

You may have to do the last step as root.

To run the supplied example, go to the samples directory
of this distribution and do:

orbit hello.lua

After the server is running go to your web browser. Some sample
urls for hello.lua:

http://127.0.0.1:8080/ will show "Hello World!"
http://127.0.0.1:8080/say/foo will show "Hello foo!"
http://127.0.0.1:8080/anythingelse will show "Not found!"

Feel free to change hello.lua while the server is running, changes
are automatically loaded. Currently there is no error treatment, though.
